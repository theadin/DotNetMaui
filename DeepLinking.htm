<b>The Super Simple tutorial on Deep Linking (Web links) for .Net Maui in Android Developers</b>
<br />
    Where I explain how to have a link to your website, open the app and handle it
<br>
<br>
Sources I used to learn this:<br>
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/android/platform/app-linking">App-Linking in Android</a><br>

Follow along with me.
<br />
<br />
  Create a new .Maui App.
<br>
<br>
    I will use Shell for navigation to demonstrate how it works, but this is not a prerequisite to do deep linking.
<br>
<br>
    Since we want to show that we can handle deep linking, we will create a second page and when the user arrives from the link we will forward the user to the second page in the app.
<br>
    So, Create a second page called <b>SecondPage.xaml</b>. I'm using the domain "aronson.co.il", replace this with your domain.
<br>
<br>
    In <b>AppShell.xaml</b> add the following so we can later navigate to the second page:
<br>
<pre>
&lt;ShellContent 
    Title=&quot;Second Page&quot; 
    ContentTemplate=&quot;{DataTemplate local:SecondPage}&quot; 
    Route=&quot;SecondPage&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
<br>

<br>
<br>
    Open MainActivity.cs
<br>
<img src="Screenshot%202023-02-01%20161412.jpg" />
          
<br>
    add the IntentFilter:
<br>
<pre>
    [IntentFilter(new[] { Android.Content.Intent.ActionView },
                      DataScheme = "http",
                      DataHost = "aronson.co.il",
                      DataPathPrefix = "/bubu",
                      AutoVerify = true,
                      Categories = new[] { Android.Content.Intent.ActionView, Android.Content.Intent.CategoryDefault, Android.Content.Intent.CategoryBrowsable })]
    [IntentFilter(new[] { Android.Content.Intent.ActionView },
                      DataScheme = "https",
                      DataHost = "aronson.co.il",
                      DataPathPrefix = "/bubu",
                      AutoVerify = true,
                      Categories = new[] { Android.Content.Intent.ActionView, Android.Content.Intent.CategoryDefault, Android.Content.Intent.CategoryBrowsable })]
</pre>
<br>
<hr>
Note: IntentFilters defined in MainActivity.cs are infused into the AndroidManifest.xml when compiling.<br>
If you want to see the XML created, go to "\obj\Debug\net7.0-android" folder and open AndroidManifest.xml file, you will see how they look in the XML:<br>
<img src="AndroidManifest.xml.jpg">
<hr>
<br>
    In the above you can see that I defined the <b>DataPathPrefix</b> to "bubu" so this means that if the link is URL + "bubu" (https://aronson.co.il/bubu) - tapping it will activate opening of app but otherwise the domain will open in the browser<br />
    <br><Br>
    To handle the event of your app being opened from a link you need to add the OnCreate function:<br />
    protected override void OnCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
<pre>
    {
      Intent intent = this.Intent;
      var action = intent.Action;
      var strLink = intent.DataString;
      if (Intent.ActionView == action && !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(strLink))
      {
          //handle intent routing
          Shell.Current.GoToAsync($"//{nameof(SecondPage)}", true);
      }
    base.OnCreate(savedInstanceState);
    }
  </pre>
    Here is what my MainActivity.cs looks like after ading the IntentFilters and the OnCreate function:
<br>
    <img src="Screenshot%202023-02-01%20155024.jpg" />
<br>
<br>
    For this to work after deploying to Google Play (without having to manually set like I will show below) you will need to add a special file to your site, I will explain about this below. But for now, let us test this in the Android Emulator. (I believe you need to have Google Play Store in the Android Emulator to see the "Open by Default" option I will describe below
<br>
<br>
<br>
    Create a webpage with an href link to aronson.co.il/bubu which you can access from the browser in the Android Emulator
<br>
<br>
    Run the app in the Emulator
<br>
<br>
    Open the "App Info" page (you can do this by opening the App Switcher screen, tapping the icon above the app and then selecting "App Info"
<img src="Screenshot%202023-02-01%20154336.jpg" />
<br>
    Scroll down to "Openb by default" and tap it
    <img src="Screenshot%202023-02-01%20154410.jpg" />
<br>
<br>
<br>
    Tap on "Add Link"
    <img src="Screenshot%202023-02-01%20154439.jpg" />
<br>
    You should see the domain you defined in the IntentFilters, tap the checkbox and then tap "Add"
<br>
<br>
<br>
    Now, go to the webpage you created in the emulator's browser
<br>
    <img src="Screenshot%202023-02-01%20154552.jpg" />
<br>
    here you can see I created two links, the top one should open the app and direct the user to second page.
<br>
    Here you can see I put a breakpoint which handles the event and I know the URL that was clicked:
<br>
    [[ add Screenshot 2023-02-01 160735.jpg]]
    <img src="Screenshot%202023-02-01%20160735.jpg" />
<br>
    The second link I have in the webpage (aronson.co.il/gaga) is to make sure that clicking on it does NOT open the app.
